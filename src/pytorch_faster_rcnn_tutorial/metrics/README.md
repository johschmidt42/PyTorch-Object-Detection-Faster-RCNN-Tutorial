To compute the metrics of an object detection model,
one can use this [opensource toolbox for object detection metrics](https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/review_object_detection_metrics).

You can find these files in their repo, the code here is slightly adjusted.

An example on how to use is it, is given in [pascal_voc_evaluator_example.py](pascal_voc_evaluator_example.py).
